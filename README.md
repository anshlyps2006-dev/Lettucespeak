#  🥬LettuceSpeak🥬 


The most over-engineered, unnecessary, and borderline irritating website called "LettuceSpeak" (yes, spelled like the vegetable) that does one thing:Every time a user types any letter, the website immediately screams that letter out loud using Text-to-Speech in the most obnoxious voice possible.

### Project Description
A very loud keyboard. The site that does less than nothing!Every time a user types any letter, the website immediately screams that letter out loud using Text-to-Speech in the most obnoxious voice possible.
.Bonus annoying features:Add loud keyboard click sounds that stack with every press. No limit.Each letter typed explodes into sparkles and rotates 360° while yelling itself . The background flash random colors with every keypress.Prevent the user from deleting anything. Backspace just yells “NOPE!”Automatically switch voices mid-word. An unskippable intro that says: “Welcome to LettuceSpeak! Serves no real purpose, drain battery, and be mildly embarrassing in public places.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People are typing silently… comfortably… in peace. 🤢


### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We bring chaos to their fingertips:
A loud, flashy, battery-draining, socially embarrassing typing experience for anyone who dares to use it.
